## Description
The Modern Post is a simple news app that collects news articles from all around the world. On the app, a user can see various curated headlines from many news sources, and can also read from the news outlet of their choice. All this is made possible by consuming the [News API](https://newsapi.org/).

## Setup/Installation Requirements

To use the app, you need to run it locally on a terminal. Use Git to clone this repository.
```
$ git clone https://github.com/VictorKMaina/password-vault.git
```

The app requires Python to run. To install Python on Ubuntu, do this:
```
$ sudo apt install python3.9
```

Once this is done, navigate in the `password-vault` directory and run the app.
```
$ ./run.py
```

## Navigating the app
Upon running the app, this is what you will see:
```
Welcome to PassLocker.

1. Create New Account
2. Log In
3. Show existing users
4. Exit PassLocker

Choose an option:
```

To create a new account, enter `1`.

All the navigation in the app is done in similar format, as directed by its instructions.

## Known Issues
Currently, a user cannot delete an account once they've have added. Another issue is that the app can create more than one user account with the same name. These will be resolved in later development.
